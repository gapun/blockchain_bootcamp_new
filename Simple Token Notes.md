Explain 1000000 * 10 ** decimals() in solidity
In Solidity, the decimals() function is commonly used in ERC20 token contracts to determine the number of decimal places that the token uses for fractional values. The decimals() function returns a uint8 value that specifies the number of decimal places, so for example, if decimals() returns 18, it means that the token has 18 decimal places, and the smallest unit of the token is 1 wei.

The expression 10 ** decimals() is used to calculate the value of 10 to the power of the number of decimal places. For example, if decimals() returns 18, then 10 ** decimals() will evaluate to 10^18, which is a very large number.

The expression 1000000 * 10 ** decimals() is multiplying the number 1000000 by 10 to the power of the number of decimal places. This is a common operation in Solidity when defining the initial supply of an ERC20 token. By multiplying a large number by 10 to the power of the number of decimal places, the token contract ensures that the initial supply has the correct number of decimal places, even if the token has a large number of total supply units.

For example, if the token has 18 decimal places and an initial supply of 1 million tokens, then 1000000 * 10 ** decimals() would evaluate to 1000000000000000000000000, which is equivalent to 1 million tokens with 18 decimal places.
